# Daniel “Dan” Beck

Hi. I’m a Christian full-stack web developer with a passion for building great
user experiences. I am experienced in JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS/SCSS, and
HTML/Pug. I also have limited experience with MongoDB. <!-- I’m currently working on a few different projects, including a [Matrix.org] client (screenshot below). If you care about free speech and privacy, you should check it out! 🔥 -->

## ProjectName

(insert screenshot of matrix client here)

[ProjectName] is an elegant and feature rich [Matrix.org] client. It’s essentially Discord Nitro, if Discord were serious on privacy and security, without which the free world [cannot exist][why privacy matters]. It’s straightforward to set up and get started. Definitely check it out, and [let me know your thoughts][projectname feedback]!

## VSCode Theme

(insert screenshot of VSCode theme)
